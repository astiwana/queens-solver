# Queens LinkedIn Game Solver

A simple Python script that solves the [Queens](https://www.linkedin.com/games/queens) game on LinkedIn. This also works for games like [Crowns](https://gameofcrowns.sanish.me/challenges/random). Uses OpenCV to detect and create the game grid and solves it using backtracking.
