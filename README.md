# Queens LinkedIn Game Solver

A simple Python script that solves the [Queens](https://www.linkedin.com/games/queens) game on LinkedIn. This also works for games like [Crowns](https://gameofcrowns.sanish.me/). It uses OpenCV to detect and create the game grid and then solves it using backtracking.

## Usage

Take a screenshot of the grid and save it in the same directory as the script. Execute the script, and when prompted enter the name of the screenshot file and the size of the grid. The script will do its magic and the solved game output will be displayed.
